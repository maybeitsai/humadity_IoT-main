## Introduction

The Humidity IoT System is designed to monitor humidity levels in real-time. Data is collected using a DHT11 sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller, which then communicates with a Flask-based web application. This system allows users to view current and historical humidity data through a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- Real-time humidity monitoring
- Historical data visualization
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask
- Lightweight and efficient communication between ESP32 and Flask server
